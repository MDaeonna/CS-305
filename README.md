# CS-305 READ ME
1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? Artemis Financial is a fintech company specializing in investment management solutions. Their primary concern was enhancing their software to improve portfolio management, risk assessment, and client communication. They wanted me to develop a comprehensive software solution that could streamline these processes and provide actionable insights for their clients.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? I conducted a comprehensive security audit for Artemis Financial, leveraging both automated scanning tools and manual inspection techniques to identify vulnerabilities. This thorough approach enabled me to bolster the software's defenses effectively. 
Coding securely is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data, protecting against cyber threats, and maintaining the software's integrity. By addressing vulnerabilities proactively, I helped Artemis Financial mitigate the risk of data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. Secure software enhances trust among clients, investors, and stakeholders, fosters long-term relationships, and minimizes disruptions to business operations, ensuring continuity and stability in the face of cyber threats.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? One challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was identifying potential security weaknesses that might not be detected by automated scanning tools. Manual inspection required a keen understanding of complex software architectures and potential attack vectors, demanding meticulous attention to detail and thorough analysis. However, this manual approach proved invaluable in uncovering nuanced vulnerabilities and providing tailored solutions to enhance the software's security posture.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? To increase layers of security for Artemis Financial's software, I employed a multi-faceted approach. First, I conducted thorough code reviews, adhering to industry best practices and standards to rectify any security vulnerabilities present. Next, I strengthened authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data and functionalities. Additionally, encryption techniques were implemented to protect data at rest and in transit from unauthorized access. I also integrated comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. For future vulnerability assessments, I plan to utilize a combination of automated scanning tools, penetration testing, and threat modeling techniques.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? To ensure both functionality and security of the code and software application, I conducted rigorous testing procedures. This included thorough unit testing to verify individual code components' functionality and integration testing to assess module interactions. Security concerns were addressed through extensive vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code review. After refactoring the code, I conducted regression testing to ensure changes didn't affect functionality and performed security testing to check for newly introduced vulnerabilities. By implementing these measures, I ensured the code and software remained both functional and secure throughout development.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? In this project, I utilized a variety of resources, tools, and coding practices that could be valuable for future assignments or tasks. I made extensive use of automated scanning tools for vulnerability assessment, such as Nessus or OWASP ZAP, which expedited the identification of security weaknesses. Additionally, I relied on manual inspection techniques and code review practices to uncover nuanced vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss. Adhering to industry best practices and standards, such as OWASP guidelines, ensured robust security measures were implemented effectively.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? For future employers, I would present several artifacts from this assignment to showcase my skills, knowledge, and experience. This would include a comprehensive security audit report detailing vulnerabilities identified and addressed, demonstrating my ability to enhance software security effectively. Additionally, documentation outlining the code refactoring process and testing plan, along with the results of unit testing, integration testing, and security testing, would showcase my proficiency in improving code quality and ensuring both functionality and security of software applications. I would also highlight the configuration of a CI/CD pipeline to automate code deployment while maintaining security standards, illustrating my expertise in implementing DevSecOps practices. Lastly, I would provide sample code snippets exemplifying best practices in security implementation, such as input validation and encryption, to underscore my coding proficiency and commitment to security standards. These artifacts would serve as tangible evidence of my accomplishments in software development, security auditing, and quality assurance, positioning me as a valuable asset for future roles requiring similar expertise.
